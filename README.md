# Car-Rental-System 🚘
Explore the world of car rentals with the Car Rental System 🚘, a Java-based console application designed to simulate real-life vehicle rentals while providing a hands-on learning experience. This project utilizes object-oriented principles to manage cars, customers, and rental transactions seamlessly.

# Features
🚗 Rent a Car: Experience the ease of renting cars through an interactive console. 
🔁 Return a Car: Effortlessly return previously rented cars and update availability. 
🚗 Car Management: Add, update, and remove car listings with details like model, brand, rental rates, and availability status. 
👥 Customer Management: Register new customers, view their details, and track their rental history. 
Rental Transactions: Facilitate car rentals with start and end dates, calculate rental costs, and generate receipts. 
📝 Rental History: Track and display a history of all previous rentals, including active and completed rentals.

# Future Roadmap
The system ensures that multiple customers can rent the same car at different times by checking and preventing overlapping bookings. It also adjusts rental prices based on the date and season, and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly, visual experience.
